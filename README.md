# My first pytorch deep learning model
Hi everyone! This repository contains my first pytorch deep learning model (it may be used as part of any bigger model), or as a model predicting results for tabular data itself. 

What's more, it consists my model for digit recognition competition on kaggle.com. I intend to add more and more submissions for different Kaggle competitions.
